<hr>
<p>On the 12th of December 2015 during the COP21 in Paris, 196 nations agreed to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.</br>
For transparency and accountability, it is important that the information about the progress reach as much people as possible.
Therefore, this website gives a view on the progress of each country on their parth to carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
<p><a href='https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement'>United Nations Climate Change:</a></p>
<blockquote>The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016.
Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a <em>climate neutral world by mid-century.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>The methodology is simple. Given that all countries have signed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>*,
global emissions should reach <em>net-zero by the middle of the 21st century.</em>
Therefore, taking the change of CO2 emissions from 2015 to the last available data (currently 2020) and <em>linearly extrapolating</em> until 2050,
we can have an idea if each country is on the right path to reach net-zero.</p>
<p>Some countries signed the agreement, but didn't pledge for net-zero at 2050, for example China (2060) and India (2070).
But to for the goal of 1.5 degree celsius to be reached, global net-zero needs to be reached in 2050 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">according to the ICPP.</a>
Therefore, to facilitate the comprehension and the comparison of the data vizualisation, the carbon neutral target is 2050 for all countries.</p>
