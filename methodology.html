	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<p><a href='https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement'>United Nations Climate Change:</a></p>
	<blockquote>The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016.
	Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
	To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a <em>climate neutral world by mid-century.</em>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The methodology is simple. Given that all countries have signed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>*,
	global emissions should reach <em>net-zero by the middle of the 21st century.</em>
	Therefore, taking the change of CO2 emissions from 2015 to the last available data (currently 2020) and <em>linearly extrapolating</em> until 2050,
	we can have an idea if each country is on the right path to reach net-zero.</p>
	<p>Some countries signed the agreement, but didn't pledge for net-zero at 2050, for example China (2060) and India (2070).
	But to for the goal of 1.5 degree celsius to be reached, global net-zero needs to be reached in 2050 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">according to the ICPP.</a>
	Therefore, to facilitate the comprehension and the comparison of the data vizualisation, the carbon neutral target is 2050 for all countries.</p>
	
	<h2>Why linear extrapolation and not another curve?</h2>
	<p><b>Argument:</b> The curve should decrease faster and faster since the countries will need time to put their programmes into practice and have them deliver effects.</p>
	<p><b>Counter-argument:</b> 2015 is not the starting point of environmental awareness.
	In fact, it happened during the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP21'>COP21</a> which was the 21st edition of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference>United Nations Climate Change conference</a>.
	States were aware of the problem long before. There is no excuse for not implementing their program earlier.<br>
	Also, you may argue that the first gains will be easier to realise because there is a lot of <i>low hanging fruits to catch</i> and reducing the last bit of emissions will be harder.</p>
	<p>I am willing to add more complexe models in the future (I am aware that there is some awesome predictive models out there), but I am worried that the complexity will decrease the user-experience.</p>
	
	<h2>Carbon neutrality or Net zero?</h2>
	<p>The two concepts are similar but carbon neutrality refers only to CO2 emissions while net zero includes all the greenhouse gases.<br>
	I would rather provide net zero emissions since it makes for a more complete picture, but unfortunatly I haven't found country data for the period after 2018.<br>
	Carbon sinks are included in the carbon data.</p>
